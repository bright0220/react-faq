By definition everything it does can be reproduced (and some people have with other libraries/frameworks that follow similar conventions). The point is not that React does something that you can‚Äôt, but rather that by introducing React to your application you are relieved of having to worry about manually handling your DOM, manually determining how to update it efficiently, minimizing traversals, etc. - <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-ReactJS-faster-than-direct-DOM-manipulation-with-JavaScript-or-jQuery\">Sean Grogg</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Key Takeaway:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>React keeps your product reasonably fast without you having to think about it all the time, or to jump through the hoops <strong>@dan_abramov</strong></p>\n</blockquote>",
