This ‘governed’ data is then saved to state (in this case, the parent/container component’s state).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data displayed by a controlled component is received through props passed down from it’s parent/container component.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a one-way loop – from (1) child component input (2) to parent component state and (3) back down to the child component via props – is what is meant by unidirectional data flow in React.js application architecture.</p>\n</blockquote>",
