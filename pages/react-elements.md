> Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
> Elements are what components are "made of ..."
â€” [React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)
- An element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties
- An element is not an actual instance. Rather, it is a way to tell React what you want to see on the screen

// element is what you return from a component

const DeleteAccount = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Are you sure?</p>
    <DangerButton>Yep</DangerButton>
    <Button color='blue'>Cancel</Button>
  </div>
);
