#Components
> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. - [React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html)

**What are some of your best practices when working with components?**

> * Keep it (F)ocused.
* Keep it (I)ndependent.
* Keep it (R)eusable.
* Keep it (S)mall.
* Keep it (T)estable.
* or in short, `FIRST`.

**How do I output a list of items?**

```javascript
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
````
