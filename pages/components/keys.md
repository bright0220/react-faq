>React uses [keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html#keys) to help with Reconciliation (i.e. how it calculates the DOM diff for each render).

```
<ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
```

>  As noted in 'What should I use for a key?' Be careful what you use for a key.  Using an array index isn't a best practice... aim to use a unique id.

**Do keys across an app all need to be unique?**

No - Keys used only need to be unique among their siblings.
